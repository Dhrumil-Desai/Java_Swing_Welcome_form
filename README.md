📝 Welcome Form Application (Java Swing GUI)
This project is a Java Swing-based desktop GUI application that simulates a user registration form with real-time feedback and dynamic appearance customization. It's a beginner-friendly but feature-rich Java project that showcases the use of core Java concepts like OOP, event handling, layout management, and UI theming.

🚀 Features
User Input Form: Accepts details like First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone Number, Gender, and Birthdate using text fields, radio buttons, and dropdowns.

Welcome Message: Displays a personalized greeting message with all submitted details in a stylized label after clicking the "OK" button.

Reset Functionality: Clears all fields and selections to let the user re-enter information using the "Reset" button.

Exit Confirmation: On clicking "Exit", a confirmation dialog ensures the user does not accidentally close the application.

Theme Toggle (Light, Dark, Default): A Mode button presents a popup menu allowing the user to toggle between three color themes dynamically, updating all UI components.

Icon Customization: The application frame uses a custom window icon representing a handshake/logo image.

Dynamic Layouts: Components are arranged using GridLayout, FlowLayout, and BorderLayout for an organized and responsive UI.
